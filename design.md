# Step-by-Step Development Plan

## Day 1-2: Backend Development with FastAPI

Set up FastAPI for creating RESTful APIs.

Create endpoints for receiving and processing mock satellite telemetry data.

Implement API endpoints for command and control interactions.

## Day 3: Data Streaming with Kafka

Set up a Kafka instance (using Docker or a managed service).

Write a producer to simulate real-time satellite data streams.

Implement a consumer in FastAPI to process and forward data to InfluxDB.

## Day 4: Time-Series Data Storage with InfluxDB

Set up InfluxDB for storing telemetry data.

Create schemas for different types of satellite data (e.g., telemetry, commands).

Implement database interactions in FastAPI.

## Day 5: Data Visualization with Grafana

Install and configure Grafana to visualize data from InfluxDB.

Create dashboards to display real-time telemetry and historical data trends.

## Day 6: Cloud Deployment

Dockerize the application and set up a Kubernetes cluster (use Minikube locally or AWS EKS).

Deploy the application using Helm charts for Kubernetes.

Use AWS Lambda for specific serverless tasks, like processing telemetry alerts.

## Day 7: Final Touches and CI/CD

Implement basic CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions or another CI tool.

Refine the application for fault tolerance and low latency.

Conduct testing and ensure the application runs smoothly in the cloud.

Mock Satellite Data Generation

Simulate satellite telemetry with Python scripts.

Generate realistic data patterns (e.g., orbital position, system health metrics).

Key Focus Areas

Cloud Architecture: Design a scalable, fault-tolerant system using cloud-native technologies.

API Development: Build robust and secure APIs for data ingestion and control.

Infrastructure Management: Utilize Kubernetes and Helm for deploying and managing applications.

Data Integration: Process and visualize telemetry data with Kafka, InfluxDB, and Grafana.


Outcome

By following this plan, you'll build a comprehensive project that covers the core responsibilities and technologies mentioned in the job description. This will give you practical experience and prepare you for the backend engineering role at Muon Space.
