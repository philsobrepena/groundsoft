# Kubernetes Learnings

## What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes (K8s) is a container orchestration system that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## Core Concepts

### Container Orchestration
- Manages multiple containers across multiple servers
- Automates deployment and scaling
- Handles container lifecycle management
- Provides service discovery and load balancing

### Load Balancing
- Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers
- Prevents any single server from becoming overwhelmed
- Routes requests to healthy servers only
- Enables horizontal scaling

### Failover Protection
- Automatically detects server failures
- Redirects traffic away from failed servers
- Starts replacement containers automatically
- Ensures continuous service availability

### Auto-scaling
- Monitors application load and performance
- Adds new servers during high traffic
- Removes servers during low traffic
- Optimizes resource usage

## When to Use Kubernetes

### Good Use Cases
- High-availability requirements
- Variable load applications
- Microservices architecture
- Complex deployment requirements
- Need for automated scaling
- Production-grade applications

### Might Be Overkill For
- Simple applications
- Low traffic services
- Small team/limited DevOps resources
- Cost-sensitive projects
- Single container applications

## Basic Architecture

yaml
Kubernetes Cluster:
├── Control Plane (Manager)
│ ├── API Server
│ ├── Scheduler
│ └── Controller Manager
│
└── Nodes (Workers)
├── Containers
├── Networking
└── Storage

## Common Operations
- Deployment management
- Service scaling
- Health monitoring
- Log collection
- Configuration management
- Secret management

## Benefits
1. High Availability
2. Scalability
3. Disaster Recovery
4. Resource Optimization
5. Automated Operations
6. Consistent Environment
